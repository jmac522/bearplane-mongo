          We will let you know what he is about when he is done taking a shit.
        %p
          Brian earned a degree in jazz and contemporary music from the University of Maine
          at Augusta, then moved to Boston where he completed his education by
          performing with local mbalax group M'bolo and busking in the MBTA
          subway system. While proficient in a variety of styles, Brian is most
          at home in the context of Bearplane's collective improvisations.
          He currently spends his days making web applications for the Man.
        %p
          Brian plays music to make ends meet until he can realize his true dream
          of owning a vegan bakery called Jabrownies. This is real.
